					<h2> Legend of the Bermuda Triangle </h2>
				</center>
					<p> The Bermuda Triangle, which is commonly known as the Devil's Triangle,
						covers 500,000 square miles of ocean and is located off the southern tip of Florida.
						Christopher Columbus was known as the first person who has sailed through the mysterious
						area of water. On his first voyage to the New World, he reported to have seen a great flame
						of fire, which crashed into the sea, only to see a strange light appear in the distance a 
						few weeks later. He continued to write about erratic compass readings, which probably 
						occured because at the time, a sliver of the Bermuda Triangle was one of the few places
						on Earth where true north and magnetic north lined up.
