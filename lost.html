									and was flying his own aircraft: The Navion A16, which was 
									said to have been maintained very well.It was recorded that 
									the plane's tank was full and the distance was short, so shortage 
									of fuel was never a problem. In the middle of the flight, Bob contacted
									the control tower at Miami to check the weather. The control tower 
									reported that there was a major storm ahead, and that he should take a 
									detour. That was the last time Bob could be contacted. US Coast 
									Gaurds tried looking for him, but there was no evidence of the 
									Navion A16.</p>
