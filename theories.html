						<h2> Conspiracy Theories </h2>
							<ul>
								<li> Freak Waves: </li>
							</ul>
								<p> The occuring of freak waves is a possibility that it is the cause
								of multiple disappearances of the Bermuda Triangle. After all, freak 
								waves can appear at sudden moments, despite having a calm sea. Research
								shows that freak waves have the ability to be up to 30m high and are capable 
								of sinking a large ship within moments. Although freak waves are a rare
								orrcurance, there are certain areas of the ocean that indicate that they 
								happen more often than normal.<p>

							<ul>
								<li> The Lost City of Atlantis </li>
							</ul>	
								<p> One explanation is based on the mythological city of Atlantis and the
								technology they left behind, which were quite advanced. The legend says that
								the city of Atlantis heavily depended on special enerygy crystals. These 
								crystals were told to be extremely powerful. They radiated large amounts of 
								energy (also known as death rays), which caused the navigationals systems of 
								passing ships and airplanes to malfunction. This resulted to being lost at sea,
								or just completely destroyed by the energy.</p>

											<h2> Why my explanation is correct:</h2>
											<p>There is evidence that whirlpools and blue holes occur in the Bermuda Triangle, which is 
											the reason why disappearances in the Bermuda Triangle are so common. For example,
											there has been notice of these occurances in the Bahamas, which is located at the western
											corner of the Bermuda Triangle and about 50 miles off the coast of Florida. Divers have also
											discovered many lateral tunnels that have been created from the walls of the blue hole. These 
											run for miles in different directions. </p>
